                    Hello, my name is Khoa Nguyen, and I'm a recent graduate from Arizona State University with a major in Computer Science. 
                    Born and raised in Mesa, Arizona, I grew up with loving and caring parents and had many opportunities to experience many different things along the way.
                    <br><br>
                    My favorite quote is:  
                </p>

                <blockquote cite = "Shiroe from Log Horizon"> If you can't do something, then don't. Focus on what you can do. </blockquote>
                <p>
                    This quote is by the character Shiroe from <cite>Log Horizon</cite>. To give context of this quote, when a person finds themself in a difficult situation 
                    where they know that they need to achieve a result but lack the ability to get there, the quote directly states that the individual should place their 
                    focus on something, a task or a result, that they are able to achieve.
                </p>
